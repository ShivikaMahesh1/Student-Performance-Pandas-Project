# 📊 Student Performance Data Analysis (Pandas | Jupyter)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insight generation using Python (Pandas) in a Jupyter Notebook.  
The objective is to transform raw student performance data into a clean, analysis-ready dataset and uncover meaningful patterns that influence academic outcomes.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and standardize raw data for analysis
- Handle missing values and duplicates effectively
- Perform exploratory data analysis to identify trends
- Generate insights based on demographic and academic factors
- Build a reproducible, well-documented analysis workflow

---
## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

## 📂 Project Workflow

### Data Loading & Inspection
- Imported dataset using `pandas.read_csv()`
- Inspected structure using `head()`, `info()`, and `shape()`
- Reviewed column names, data types, and dataset size

**Impact:**  
Established a clear understanding of data quality and cleaning requirements.

---

###  Data Quality Assessment
- Checked missing values using `isnull().sum()`

**Impact:**  
Ensured data reliability and prevented skewed analysis.

---

### Mean
- Applied mean/median imputation for numerical features

---

### Data Type Standardization
- Converted columns to appropriate data types using `astype()`
- Ensured numerical and categorical fields were correctly formatted

**Impact:**  
Enabled accurate calculations and efficient data processing.

---

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Used `describe()` for statistical summaries
- Applied `value_counts()` for categorical distributions
- Performed grouped analysis using `groupby()`

**Insights Explored:**
- Student performance by gender
- Impact of parental education
- Effect of test preparation on scores

**Impact:**  
Identified key performance drivers and meaningful trends.

---

### Aggregation & Comparative Analysis
- Used `groupby().mean()`, `sum()`, and `count()` for comparison
- Analyzed performance across demographic segments

**Impact:**  
Supported data-driven conclusions and hypothesis testing.

---

### 8️⃣ Data Validation & Final Dataset Preparation
- Re-verified missing values and duplicates post-cleaning
- Ensured consistency across all columns

**Impact:**  
Delivered a clean, analysis-ready dataset for further modeling or visualization.

---

### 9️⃣ Documentation & Reproducibility
- Structured the notebook logically (Load → Clean → Analyze)
- Added markdown explanations for every major step

**Impact:**  
Improved reproducibility and made the project portfolio-ready.

---

## 📈 Key Outcomes
- Cleaned and standardized student performance dataset
- Identified factors influencing academic outcomes
- Built a reusable data analysis workflow using Pandas

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add advanced visualizations and dashboards
- Perform statistical hypothesis testing
- Build predictive models for student performance
- Automate data cleaning pipeline
